# What is reCAPTCHA?

- security service designed to protect websites from spam and abuse by distinguishing between human users and automated bots.
- reCAPTCHA is commonly used in forms, login pages, and other areas where user input is required.
- The goal of reCAPTCHA is to improve user experience by blocking bots while minimizing friction for legitimate users.

## There are different versions of Google reCAPTCHA:

1. ### reCAPTCHA v2:

- This version shows a checkbox labeled "I'm not a robot" that users can click to verify they are human.
- Sometimes, it presents additional challenges (e.g., image recognition tasks) if suspicious activity is detected

2. ### reCAPTCHA v3:

- This version is invisible to users and works behind the scenes, assigning a score to each interaction based on the likelihood of it being a bot. Website owners can use this score to decide how to handle interactions, such as requiring additional verification for lower scores.

3. ### Invisible reCAPTCHA:

- This is similar to v2 but without requiring the user to click a checkbox. It runs automatically, and challenges are shown only if suspicious behavior is detected.
